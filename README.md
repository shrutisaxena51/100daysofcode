<h1 align="center"> 100 days of Code </h1>
<p align="center">The idea of this project is to commit yourself at least one hour of a day to code in any language. The regularity is key here, you need to practice a bit everyday, including the weekends. All the challenges present here are easy/medium/hard level, starting from easy level. You can (and you should) participate even if you don't have much experience with coding, it will only take a bit longer. Most of the challenges can be solved in three hours or less. </p>
